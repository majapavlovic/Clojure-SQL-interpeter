# Clojure SQL Interpreter

This college project is a simple and lightweight SQL-like interpreter built in Clojure. It allows querying CSV files using a subset of SQL syntax directly from the console.

## Features

Supports basic SQL operations

- `SELECT` with column names or `*`
- `WHERE` clause with operators: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `LIKE`, `IN (...)`, `BETWEEN ...` operators to be used with `WHERE`
- `AND` and `OR` to support multiple conditions in select statements
- `ORDER BY` with multiple columns and `ASC`/`DESC`
- `LIMIT` to restrict number of returned rows
- `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates

Case-insensitive SQL parsing  
Supports multiple CSV files from the `/resources` directory  
Interactive CLI with live feedback and error handling

## Installation

Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/majapavlovic/Clojure-SQL-interpeter.git
Add your .csv to resources folder
Position to folder cd sql-interpreter
And run the app with
lein run

Run tests with
lein test

## Run examples

SELECT \* FROM client;

SELECT name, age FROM client WHERE age > 30;

SELECT name FROM client ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 3;

SELECT DISTINCT name FROM client;

SELECT \* FROM client WHERE age BETWEEN 30 AND 40;

SELECT \* FROM client WHERE name IN ('Marko', 'Jelena');

SELECT \* FROM client WHERE surname LIKE '%vic';

SELECT name FROM client WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 2

## Requirements
