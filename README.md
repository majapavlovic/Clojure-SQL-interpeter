# Clojure SQL Interpreter

This college project is a simple and lightweight SQL-like interpreter built in Clojure. It allows querying CSV files using a subset of SQL syntax directly from the console.

## Features

Supports basic SQL operations

- `SELECT` with column names or `*`
- `WHERE` clause with operators: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `LIKE`, `IN (...)`, `BETWEEN ...` operators to be used with `WHERE`
- `AND` and `OR` to support multiple conditions in select statements
- `ORDER BY` with multiple columns and `ASC`/`DESC`
- `LIMIT` to restrict number of returned rows
- `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates

Case-insensitive SQL parsing  
Supports multiple CSV files from the `/resources` directory  
Interactive CLI with live feedback and error handling
